# Aadhar-MFA
M.Tech Research Project â€“ Cybersecurity & Identity Verification

Designed and implemented a full-stack multi-factor authentication (MFA) system integrating Aadhaar validation, OTP-based verification, and behavioral biometrics (keystroke dynamics, mouse movements).

Developed and trained machine learning models (Isolation Forest, Random Forest) for real-time user profiling and anomaly detection.

Built a web-based interface for end-to-end testing, integrated device fingerprinting and environment metadata for enhanced risk scoring.

Implemented spoof detection and continuous behavioral monitoring to protect against identity fraud and session hijacking.

Used Python, Flask, SQLAlchemy, JavaScript, and NumPy with a modular ML pipeline for profile learning and classification.

Enabled secure OTP workflow with Verhoeff validation and privacy-preserving Aadhaar hashing using SHA-256.

Tools & Tech: Python, Flask, SQLite, Scikit-learn, JavaScript, ML, Risk Analytics, WebAuthn principles, Secure Authentication
Outcome: Demonstrated 90%+ behavioral profile classification accuracy; built a working prototype suitable for Aadhaar-enabled services.
